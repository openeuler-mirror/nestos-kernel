	  This driver add two extra supports for memory devices. The driver
	  provides methods for userpace to control the power of memory devices
	  in a container. Besides, it provides extra locality information
	  between cpus and memory devices for userspace, which can take
	  advantage of this functionality to select the closet memory device
	  to a certain cpu.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called hisi_hbmdev.

	depends on ACPI
	help
	  This driver provids methods to control the power of hbm cache device
	  in hisi soc. Use hbm as a cache can take advantage of hbm's high
	  bandwidth in normal memory access.

	  To compile the driver as a module, choose M here:
	  the module will be called hisi_hbmcache.

config HISI_HBMDEV_ACLS

	help
	  Add ACLS support for hbm device, which can be used to query and
	  repair hardware error in HBM devices. This feature need to work with
	  hardware firmwares.

	  If not sure say no.

	  The Huawei Cache Coherence System (HCCS) is a multi-chip
	  interconnection bus protocol.
	  The performance of application may be affected if some HCCS
	  ports are not in full lane status, have a large number of CRC
	  errors and so on.

	  Say M here if you want to include support for querying the
	  health status and port information of HCCS on Kunpeng SoC.
